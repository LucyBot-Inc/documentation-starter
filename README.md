# LucyBot Starter API Console
This is the default build for [LucyBot's API Documentation](http://lucybot.com).
It can be used in non-commercial projects, or for demo purposes.

Check out the [Pet Store demo](http://demo.lucybot.com)

Commercial licenses and additional features are available at [lucybot.com](http://lucybot.com)

## Usage
Simply fork this repository and replace `openapi.json` with your
[OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/).

> Have RAML, WADL, API Blueprint, or I/O Docs?
> Check out [api-spec-converter](https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter)

The easiest way to serve the documentation is with GitHub pages: in your fork,
visit the Settings page, and choose "master branch" as the source in the
GitHub Pages section. You can also set a custom domain there.

You can also serve this directory with Apache, NodeJS, PHP, etc.

## Customization
### Title and Description
The API title and description are controlled by
the `info` field in `openapi.json`.  You can use
[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
in the description.

### Themes
You can use your own Bootstrap theme to customize colors, fonts, sizes, and more.
Just replace `dist/bootstrap.css` with your own bootstrap.css

* [Strapping!](http://bobby-brennan.github.io/strapping)
